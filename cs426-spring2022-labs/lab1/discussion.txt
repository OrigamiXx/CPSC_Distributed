Dial() is quite similar to socket() and connect(), in the sense it establishes a connection by giving an address and then allocating the necessary port and resource for the connection.
This is cooperated by the listen() on the server side.

A2
Many issues could possibly cause a dial failure.
Bad connection, slow internet -- DeadlineExceeded, as name suggests, operation expired before completion
Server broken -- Internal, bad programming, wrong intructions, etc.
Other errors such bad error codes returned, rare issues -- Unknown
No ports available -- ResourceExhausted or Unavailable, I incline to ResourceExhausted which indiates the requested port is busy now

When GetUser is called, send(), recv() are definitely used, in the sense that client sends a request rpc, and server receives it. Vice versa. During these calls the standard
read() and write() system calls will be used. These functions might throw errors when there is a sigmentation fault or mathematics fault(like divide by 0). read() and write() can generate these
basic sigmentation fault or mathematics fault, but when it propagates to the network errors it will be shown as internal errors. In terms of network issues, an expired connection
may give a timeout error or a DeadlineExceeded code,

In addition to those, GetUser() may have its own checks that still throw errors even if all related netorks are fine. It might throw a NotFound code if the user looked for is NotFound
found, or Unimplemented or the service is unfinished.

I believe if you do so in only one call, it will be fine.

However, in concurrent situations this will definitely cause issues, since there are many threads at different stages of the call thus using the conn variable for different
purposes. It will likely fail after a certain amount of concurrent calls and yield a large amount of failed calls.
