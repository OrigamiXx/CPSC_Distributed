## General Statement on Collaboration
TL;DR: Same as [CS323](https://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs323/current/syllabus.html)for the individual labs (which Labs 0-4 are).

Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process in which you must reach your own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution. During this time, discussions with others (including members of the teaching staff) are encouraged. But see the Gilligan's Island Rule below.

However, when the time comes to design the program and write the code, such discussions are no longer appropriate---your solution must be your own personal inspiration (although you may ask members of the teaching staff for help in understanding, designing, writing, and debugging).

Since code reuse is an important part of programming, you may study and/or incorporate published code (e.g., from text books or the Net) in your programs, provided that you give proper attribution in your source code and in your log file and that the bulk of the code submitted is your own. Note: Removing/rewriting comments, renaming functions/variables, or reformatting statements does not convey ownership.

But when you incorporate more than 25 lines of code from a single source, this code (prefaced by a comment identifying the source) must be isolated in a separate file that the rest of your code #include-s or links with. The initial submission of this file should contain only the identifying comment and the original code; revisions may only change types or function/variable names, turn blocks of code into functions, or add comments.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COPY SOMEONE ELSE'S CODE OR GIVE A COPY OF YOUR CODE TO SOMEONE ELSE OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE---to do so is a clear violation of ethical/academic standards that, when discovered, will be referred to the Executive Committee of Yale College for disciplinary action. Modifying code to conceal copying only compounds the offense.

## The Gilligan's Island Rule

When discussing an assignment with anyone other than a member of the teaching staff, you may write on a board or a piece of paper, but you may not keep any written or electronic record of the discussion. Moreover, you must engage in some mind-numbing activity (e.g., watching an episode of Gilligan's Island) before you work on the assignment again. This will ensure that you can reconstruct what you learned, by yourself, using your own brain. The same rule applies to reading books or studying on-line sources.

## Tips on asking good questions / help us help you
- First, try to find the answer(s) by Googling. See above about rules re: code reuse and attribution.
- For technical questions, prefer posting to Canvas such that your classmates may answer your question(s) and benefit from the answer(s).
- Help your classmates by answering their questions! You are not in competition with one another, so help each other learn!
- Identify the [**minimum reproducible example**](https://myweb.uiowa.edu/pbreheny/reproducible.html) of your problem. E.g., for Go language related questions, attempt to construct a small example on [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/) (which has sharing functionality).
